# Motivation

While the ISS (International Space Station) positions and sightings are freely available on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration website, finding data for a particular time and place is rather difficult.  
For skywatchers, to be able to see the ISS, one will need to predict the location at a particular time, along with the visibility from their location. This project is an example containerized Flask webserver, and is designed to help with that goal, while also serving as an example for Flask REST-API containerization.  
We provide easy access to sightings of the ISS from various regions and cities in the USA, particularly the Midwest, and also provide time-based positional data for February 13, 2022. The user can then extrapolate the current and future positions of the ISS from this data.
