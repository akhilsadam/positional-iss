Unfortunately, as with any other application, technology lends itself to misuse. Location information such as that returned by this application is a security and privacy risk. For this particular case, there is no privacy risk as the ISS is an inanimate object, however, there is a security risk. As the ISS is an international research station, there is generally no reason for it to suffer harm, but the information provided here can be used for a targeted attack.
So please treat the information provided by this application wisely, and do not use it to cause harm, intentionally or unintentionally.
