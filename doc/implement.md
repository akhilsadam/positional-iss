# Implementation

This project uses Python3 (in particular Flask), and Docker for containerization. Specific Python3 package requirements can be found <a href="https://github.com/akhilsadam/positional-iss/blob/master/requirements.txt">here</a>. R and the npm package `@appnest/readme` by Andreas Mehlsen are used for documentation, but are not part of the API and will not be documented.

The source is available <a href="https://github.com/akhilsadam/positional-iss/">here</a>.
